There is no database sharing or other features that may leave you vulnerable. Your dashboard is deployed via a unique subdomain and URL string only shared with you. There is a possibility to IP lock your dashboard to any IP of your desire as well.Your seed phrase is hashed using the highest level of encryption and is not decrypted once submitted.

<p><h2>Frequently asked questions for NFT Handshake</h2></p>
<p><strong>What is NFT Handshake?</strong> NFT handshake gives you the ability to make mass bidding possible on Opensea. This is done by using the API on Opensea and communicating in the most efficient way possible with their code. The idea behind bidding on a big scale is to make money. Most people make money by flipping NFTs. This is a big hassle to do manually as mass bidding takes a great deal of time. Everything within NFT Handshake is legal and respects the TOS of Opensea. <br /><br /><strong>How exactly can I use NFT Handshake to make money?</strong> This is up to you, and there are many different ways to use our software. There are many tactics. You can check out the Tutorial or "tactics" section for ideas on how to set up your bids and what to look out for. <br /><br /><strong>What other requirements do I need to consider?</strong> In order to bid on NFTs you need to have wrapped Ethereum or weth in your wallet. You can submit bids for 1000x of the balance of your wallet. If you have 2 weth in your wallet, the value of your combined bids can max be 2000 weth. an example would be that you can submit 1000 bids of 2 eth each. or 2000 bids of 1 eth each. (total value is 1000x of your wallet balance) <br /><br /><strong>What is my expected return on investment for these subscriptions?</strong> That depends on how much time you spend on setting up your bids, doing your research and so on. We have personally had months with over 50 eth of profit. It really depends on your dedication. The more weth you have in your wallet, the easier it gets to make big profits because you can submit more bids. You should see greater profits each month as your wallet gets bigger and you can launch more bids. <br /><br /><strong>What support can i expect after i buy my subscription and how do I get it?</strong> We are available on the discord every single day of the year. We are scaling our team to even provide tech support day and night as well. We will be sharing our knowledge and skills throughout our discord daily and you are always welcome to message us with any questions you may have. Excellent customer service is our thing. <br /><br /><strong>What makes NFT Handshake different from other tools </strong> We are the only tool on the market that does NOT ask you to download anything to your desktop. We deploy a dedicated server and dedicate proxies only for your use. There is no database sharing or connections to other users. You will also have your own subdomain login path that you get to name yourself. We provide ourselves on having the highest security protocols in place in the industry. We also provide you with the most amount of bids per minutes/threads and this gives you the ability to scale a lot more. Rarity-based bidding is another feature of ours that is completely unique and allows you to make greater profits than ever seen before. <br /><br /><strong>Am I allowed to share my subscription? </strong> No, this subscription is just for you and you should never give access to your server to anyone else. This is for your own sake as well. We will close down servers immediately if we can see activities of shared access. <br /><br /><strong>Do i need an API key for Opensea?</strong> No, we provide all these things for you. Part of your subscription fee goes towards a handful of services we pay for to keep your account running smoothly and safely. <br /><br /><strong>What personal details/wallet info do i need to provide for NFT Handshake to work?</strong> In order to pass information to Opensea via their API, your wallet information will have to be used, including your private key. We know how sensitive this is and for that reason, we encrypt your data as soon as you submit it. This information can not be accessed by us or anyone using the software. Not even yourself. Once the data has been saved, it is impossible to view it again. You can only delete your wallet from NFT Handshake at that point. We also recommend you set up a new wallet for the purpose of using our tool, just for ease of mind, and only deposit the weth you want to use for bidding. <br /><br /><strong>Is it possible to try a demo of your service? </strong>Yes, we provide a demo account for 0.30 eth. You will have access for 24 hours and the account has 2 threads. The fee will be deducted from your first subscription plan should you choose to subscribe. Keep in mind we have a very limited amount of demo accounts available.</p>
